# Hackathon-2025
Context: Filing FIRS in India is often slow and inaccessible, discouraging timely reporting—especially for victims in remote or vulnerable situations.
Challange : Design a secure web platform that enables users to file FIRS online using Aadhaar-based OTP and digital
signatures. Key features include anonymous reporting (with optional later identity verification), digital evidence
upload with secure metadata handling, FIR preview before submission, case tracking dashboard with real-time
updates, integration with CCTNS for SHO routing and approval, and appointment booking for in-person police
verification.
